Feel tired when you look at this?

if you download our application, you will no longer need to go through the whole
table to find your status of CSE11 course.

(Click [here](https://github.com/mygradesource/mygradesource-app/blob/master/MyGradeSource.jar?raw=true) to download.)

(If you cannot run the app, you need to install Java before you run it.)
([Link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))

After downloading "My GradeSource", just click it to open.

And enter your secret number in the textfield...

There you go! The result just came out!

If you want to see the whole table, you can click "Show All.." button that will use
default web browser to open the source website.

If you don't have secret number since you didn't take this course, don't worry!
We've prepared a demo mode for you! Just type "demo" in the textfield.

The application will randomly pick up a secret number and show the result!

That's simple, right? Enjoy our "My GradeSource"!
