if you download our application, you will no longer need to go through the whole
table to find your status of CSE11 course.

(Click [here](https://github.com/mygradesource/mygradesource-app/blob/master/MyGradeSource.jar?raw=true) to download.)

(You need to have Java installed before running this application.)

If you want to see the whole table, you can click the "Show All.." button which
will open the source website in your default web browser.

Don’t have a secret number because you didn't take this course? Don’t worry!
We’ve prepared a demo mode for you! Just type “demo” in the textfield.

The application will randomly pick a secret number and show the result!

It's simple, right? Enjoy our "My GradeSource"!
