Feel tired when you see this?

From now on, you don't have to check those bunch of unnecessary data again after
downloading our application for searching your status of CSE11 course.

(Click [here](https://github.com/mygradesource/mygradesource-app/blob/master/MyGradeSource.jar?raw=true) to download.)

(If you cannot run the app, you need to install Java before you run it.)
([Link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))

After downloading "My GradeSource", just click it to open.

And enter your secret number in the textfield...

Boom! Magic just happened!

If you want to see whole table, you can click "Show All.." button, which will use
you default web browser to open the source website.

If you don't have secret number since you didn't take this course, don't worry!
We prepared a demo mode for you! Just type "demo" in the textfield.

The application will randomly pick up a secret number and show the result!

That's simple, right? Enjoy our "My GradeSource"!
