# Hello World!

"My GradeSource" is made by

* Yu-Chia "Hank" Liu, master's student in Chemical Engineering, UCSD.
* Ming-Wei "Leon" Liu, master's student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, UCSD.

"My GradeSource" is our final project for CSE11, which is instructed by Prof. Adam Jundt in 15-16 Winter quarter.
This application is programmed by Java, which mainly includes [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/) and [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) library.

We made this application because checking our own grades on the website was never an easy task.
There is too much unnecessary data on it.

As a result, we created “My GradeSource." We hope every user can easily check his/her own scores,
current rank and current letter grade without the pain of going through all the data.

# Issue

1. This application is only for CSE11 instructed by Prof. Adam Jundt since each table
is slightly different in the GradeSource. We need more time to generalize the data for further development.

2. Originally, we want to show the whole data by using table in JavaFX. However,
it’s a little bit difficult to accomplish since It involves too many concepts of class.
Instead, we chose to use dialog to create a GUI representing users' statuses. This version
has met our primitive goal: creating a GUI to display students’ individual statuses!

We made this website with Jekyll, a Ruby gem that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs.
