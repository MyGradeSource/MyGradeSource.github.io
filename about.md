# Hello World!

"My GradeSource" is made by

* Yu-Chia "Hank" Liu, master student from chemical engineering in UCSD,
* Ming-Wei "Leon" Liu, master student from mechanical and aerospace engineering in UCSD.

"My GradeSource" is our final project for CSE11, which is instructed by Prof. Adam Jundt in 15-16 Winter quarter.
This application is programmed by Java, including [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/) and [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) library mainly.

The reason why we made this application is because it's really tedious to check our own grade on the website every time,
and there is too much unnecessary data we don't need.

As a result, we created “My GradeSource." We hope every user can easily check his/her own scores,
current rank and current letter grade without the pain of going through all the data.

# Issue

1. This application is only for CSE11 instructed by Prof. Adam Jundt since each table
is slightly different in the GradeSource. We need more time to generalize the data for further development.

2. Originally, we want to show the whole data by using table in JavaFX. However,
it’s a little bit difficult to accomplish since It involves too many concepts of class.
Instead, we chose to use dialog to create a GUI representing users' statuses. This version
has met our primitive goal: creating a GUI to display students’ individual statuses!

We made this website with Jekyll, a Ruby gem that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs.
