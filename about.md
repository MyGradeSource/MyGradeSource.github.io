# Hello World!

"My GradeSource" is made by

* Yu-Chia Liu, master student from chemical engineering in UCSD,
* Ming-Wei Liu, master student from mechanical and aerospace engineering in UCSD.

"My GradeSource" is our final project for CSE11, which is instructed by Prof. Adam Jundt in 15-16 Winter quarter.
This application is programmed by Java, including [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/) and [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) library.

The reason why we made this app is because it's really tedious to check our own grade on the website
and there is too much unnecessary data we don't need. As a result, we created "My GradeSource", and hope
every user can easily check his/her own scores, current rank and current letter grade.

# Issue

1. This application is only for overall scores from CSE11 instructed by Prof. Adam Jundt since each
table from GradeSource is slightly different. We need more time to generalize them for the further
development.

2. Originally we want to show whole bunch of data by using table in JavaFX, but it's a little bit
difficult to accomplish since it involves much more concepts of classes than only using dialog and
only showing user's status. But in this version, we've already met our primitive goal: create a GUI to
show students' status.

And, we made this website by Jekyll, a Ruby gem to transform your plain text into static websites and blogs easily.
